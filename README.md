# thinkled_morsecode

Inspired from that reddit post.

I wrote a morse translator first that'd just translate English letters to morse code. Then I wrote a function to display the morse code. For all this I reffered [the morse wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code).

I took the led on and off code from [here](https://github.com/RichusX/thinkpad-morse-led), since I had nothing to add.
